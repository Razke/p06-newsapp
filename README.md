# About
Objective: create a News feed app which gives a user regularly-updated news from the internet related to a particular topic, person, or location. The presentation of the information as well as the topic is up to you.

This project is stage 1 of a 2 stage project. For this stage, create an app to display recent news stories on a topic of your choice using an API.

**Note: the app is using a test key for The Guardian API. If the API rate limit has exceeded, you need to add your own API key to the code.**
